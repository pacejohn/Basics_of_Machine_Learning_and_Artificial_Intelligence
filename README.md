# Basics_of_Machine_Learning_and_Artificial_Intelligence
Jupyter Notebooks from my class on Basics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that I taught on April 27.  I made a some changes to the notebooks that were presented in the class.

* I added a section on using random forests for regression in the "Ensemble Methods" notebook.
* In the "Multiple Variable Linear Regression" section of the Regression notebook, I changed the models.  Instead of using "Square Feet" for the size of the house, I converted it to "Square Feet in Acres".  This puts the square footage of the house in the same units as the lot size and makes the coefficients more relevant.

All of the datasets are in the /data directory and the images are in /images.  

Hope you enjoy!
