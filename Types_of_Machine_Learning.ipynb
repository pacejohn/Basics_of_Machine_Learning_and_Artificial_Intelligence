    "* First, gather your input data.  In this case, the data consists of pictures of apples.\n",
    "* The images are annotated, or labeled, as being apples.  In a real scenario, you would have more than one class, or group, of images.  For example, you might have images of apples, oranges, and bananas.\n",
    "* Your input data does not have to be images.  You could also have numerical or categorical values.  You may have values, or features, such as height, circumference, color, and weight that are used as input to classify the fruits.\n",
    "* The input data is divided into training and validation data sets to train your model.  Training is an iterative process where each piece of input data is examined individually multiple times.\n",
    "* Once training is finished, you test your newly created model on data the model has never seen, ie, it was not part of the training or validation sets.  This unseen data is called a test set.  If the model is performing well, it should correctly classify the new data.  In this example, it would classify an image of an apple as an apple, not an orange.  If the model does not perform well (has many misclassifications), then you need to change your model.  We will discuss how to do that in subsequent parts of this series."
